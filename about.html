      <p>
        Computers have a CPU. CPU's follow instructions. Computer programmers write these instructions in a text
        editor
        in a human readable form. They then use a program called a "compiler" which changes human readable computer
        instructions into something the computer can under stand (which is numbers). The compiler also saves those
        numbers (list of instructions) to a hard disk as an executable file (a program). <br><br>

        When a program is opened to be executed, the instructions in the executable file are copied from the hard disk
        into memory. So basically there is a list of instructions in memory now; each instruction is stored one after
        the other. The CPU then just goes down the list and performs each instruction. <br><br>

        At this point you're probably asking, "why can't that be accomplished without RAM and just read the
        instructions
        from the hard drive?". Well, that's theoretically possible, but it would be ridiculously slow (hard drives are
        mechanical; RAM is electrical). Also, I lied. The CPU doesn't "simply" go down a list of instructions. It does
        do that, until it's instructed to jump somewhere else in the instruction list. And this jumping around is the
        need for RAM... <br><br>

        There is a mechanical arm on hard disks that has to move back and forth to read data. This is a very slow
        process compared to RAM which has no moving parts. And it's even slower when the arm has to "jump" around (as
        opposed to reading files sequentially). So instead of having the CPU jump around reading stuff from the hard
        drive, the instructions are copied into memory, because RAM is much faster at Randomly Accessing data.
        <br><br>

        edit: I know what your next question will be. "well, don't you have to wait for the hard drive anyway when it
        loads into memory". Yes you do... but consider that large amounts of the instructions will be repeated over
        and
        over again (but it only need to be read from the disk once) <br><br>
